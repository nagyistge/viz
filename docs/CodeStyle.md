## Code style

In this repositoryâ€”our newest front-end repository at Tidepoolâ€”our JavaScript style is *much* stricter than in our other repositories, largely because we started the work and continue to develop with a [very strict ESLint configuration, borrowed from AirBnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb 'npm: eslint-config-airbnb').

It is not worth duplicating a description of the vast number of constraints that this configuration imposes. Our advice is to configure your editor to provide instant linting feedback as you code[^a], and you will learn the constraints quite quickly ðŸ˜œ

To summarize some of the biggest constraints the AirBnb ESLint configuration imposes:
- ES2015/ES6 given preference over ES5 (so `const` and `let` over `var`, etc.)
- lots of general code quality/bug prevention constraints like no unused variables, mutating arguments to functions, etc.
- React components that don't need a (substantive) constructor, any of the lifecycle methods, or component-internal state should be [pure functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components 'React docs: Functional and Class Components') instead of classes
- all React components should type-check the props used via [PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html 'React docs: Typechecking with PropTypes')

Also see the documentation on [directory structure](./DirectoryStructure.md) for our conventions around file naming, placement, and in particular our semantic division between "containers" and "components."
